# PCF ToolBox for clustering the probability density functions&reg;

**PCF** is a MATLAB module for paper **A new possibilistic-based clustering method for probability density functions and its application to detecting abnormal elements**.

The project was started in 2023 by authors of Hung Tran-Nam, Thao Nguyen-Trang, and Ha Che-Ngoc.

Comprehensive detail of all functions is provided in the [PDF-format manual (~200 pages)](https://github.com/petercorke/spatialmath-matlab/releases/download/untagged-a2f9c8b2bd21cca9fe39/spatialmath.pdf).


Advantages of the Toolbox are that:

  * the code is mature and provides a point of comparison for other implementations of the same algorithms;
  * the routines are generally written in a straightforward manner which allows for easy understanding, perhaps at the expense of computational efficiency. If you feel strongly about computational efficiency then you can always rewrite the function to be more efficient, compile the M-file using the MATLAB compiler, or create a MEX version;
  * source code is available for the benefit for understanding and teaching.









## Installation

From the MATLAB toolstrip ```Home > Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons``` will bring up the ```Add-On Explorer```.  Enter *"PCF clustering"* into the search box, select the first entry and then click *"Add from GitHub"*.  The Toolbox will be downloaded and added to your path.


## Octave

The functions should work fine with Octave 8.4.x.

Moreover, we should install the ```statistics``` package from Octave. To load the package, run from the Octave prompt the following.

```Octave
pkg load statistics
```
